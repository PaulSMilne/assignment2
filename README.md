Sunday evening:

Have spent my time yesterday and today planning and drawing diagrams, and reading up on interfaces, enums and hashmaps.

Tonight started coding some simple getters and setters, using Sublime rather than Android. Glad I'm doing it with Sublime because it's helping me remember how everything fits together rather than let Android Studio do my thinking for me.

I'm using an Enum for the CardType, eg VISA_DEBIT("Visa Debit Card"). The Card gets initialised with a bank name and  card type. The Customer adds a "limit" which will do a calculation with spending and receiving refunds to work out how many funds are available. That's the theory anyway.
